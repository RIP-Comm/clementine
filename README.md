# Clementine - A collaborative approach to GBA emulation

Welcome to the first ripsters' project. Our goal is to understand how GameBoy Advance works and to create a modern emulator written in Rust (if you want to collaborate but you can't code in Rust take a look [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)).

Everything is work in progress. We will update this document a lot of times in this stage.
