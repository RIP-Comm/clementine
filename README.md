# Clementine - A collaborative approach to GBA emulation

Welcome to the first ripsters' project. Our goal is to understand how GameBoy Advance works and to create a modern emulator written in Rust (if you want to collaborate but you can't code in Rust take a look [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)).

Everything is work in progress. We will update this document a lot of times in this stage.


## Collaborative Guidelines
We love collaborate with others, so feel free to interact with us in every way you prefer. First of all, we strongly suggest you to enter in our Discord channel where you can find all of us ([here](https://discord.com/channels/919139369774891088/1013367016666714112)). 

In this section we are writing some basics guideline to organize better the project.

### ‚ùì Question
You can open a issue to ask question about everything related to the project. As soon as possible someone will answer to you.

### üî® Feature
These kind of issues should be used to manage the project. So only mantainers can open a new feature issue. If you would like to take a task on your own, ask for it and someone assigns it to you. 

### ü™≤ Bug
Open an issue if you find a bug. Try to describe better as possible the use case in which the bug appers. 

### ‚ûï Enanchment
Share with us your ideas about how the project could to evolve.

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è PR
Pull Request has to be linked to an issue. You need to describe better as possible what you have done. 

Keep in mind in this early stage some kind of stuff could be a mess: we are still organizing ourself.
